It is built primarily on Scala and [Akka](http://akka.io). It contains example projects as well as Maven archetypes for creating various service and creating a component. Wookiee is split into 2 primary components, the Wookiee library and the system components. The Wookiee library is comprised of the of the following components:\r\n\r\n* Command Manager - Adds and Executes commands. \r\n* Component Manager - Loads up component Jars and managers\r\n* Service Manager - Loads up user services, this is where the primary business logic for the application would reside\r\n* Health Provider - provides framework for health in components and services\r\n* Logging - provides basic logging capability for components and services\r\n* Util - Utility libraries for common functions in the code.\r\n\r\n### Command Manager\r\nThe command manager is the central actor for routing all execution of commands in our system. A command is simply the primary execution point for specific set of work. \r\nFor more information see the [Commands](docs/Commands.md) documentation.\r\n\r\n### Loading System Components\r\nThe Wookiee library loads various components when it starts up. Each component is derived through 1 of 3 methods:\r\n\r\n1. It checks the sub folders found in the root folder defined in the application config under the key \"components.component-path\". The name of the folder will be the name of the actor that is initialized by the component manager. Each component folder will contain a lib folder with all the jars that the component uses as well as the component jar. A conf file must be located in the component folder for configuration of the component. For specifics around individual components, the configuration file and the expected pattern for the component see Components section in this doc.\r\n\r\n2. It checks for jars in the aforementioned folder under the key \"components.component-path\". The jars there are expected to be shaded jars that contain all the needed libraries and config for the component in the jar. Any configuration can be overridden in your primary conf file using the config from the reference conf in the jar.\r\n\r\n3. It loads a component from a class based on the configuration that is loaded into the system. This list of components are found in the main configuration under the key \"components.lib-components\". The value of the key is a list of strings that simply point to the config for the component.\r\n\r\n4. It loads a component automatically based on a key in the config file for that component \"dynamic-component\". If the key is set to true in the config it will load up the component.*\r\n\r\n*Note If a list of components are set under the key \"component.lib-components\" there would be no components loaded automatically, essentially the last type would be switched off.\r\n\r\n### Loading Services\r\nServices that are built for Wookiee are also loaded into memory by the core. The exception to this would be if Wookiee is used just as a library or embedded in an application. In this case the service in this context is not really a service but rather an application. In general however, if Wookiee is to be used as a library it would most likely be more beneficial to use the individual system components in search for the specific functionality that your App requires. Services are loaded in a similar fashion to the components, where the services are located in sub folders found in the root folder defined in the application config under the key \"services.service-path\". The primary difference being that classes are loaded into a separate class loader instead of the root Wookiee class loader. (** note ** not the system class loader)\r\n\r\nIn most cases services will be loaded as mentioned above, however one can also load the service dynamically which will be described below:\r\n\r\n### Local Messaging\r\nThere is a cluster component which allows for messaging across a cluster. However by default Wookiee will include local messaging. The messaging works identically to how clustered messaging works, and is based on a simple PubSub methodology.\r\n\r\n### Health\r\nStandardized health checks is provided by the library. The ActorHealth trait will apply default health functionality to any actor that leverages the trait. By default, a developer would only have to insert the following code into their actor class\r\n```java\r\nclass ActorClass extends ActorHealth {\r\n\tdef receive = health orElse {\r\n\t\tcase Message => \"Do something here\"\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe above code will give the actor basic health functionality, this will do three things:\r\n\r\n* receive messages using the HealthCheck message and return a healthy healthcheck status\r\n* implement the default getHealth function which defines the health for the actor\r\n* implement the checkHealth function we will get the health of the current actor using the getHealth function above and then execute the request on the child actors and get the health status for them.\r\n\r\nGenerally a developer would want to override the getHealth function to give customized health check status for the actor. Example:\r\n```java\r\n\toverride def getHealth : Future[HealthComponent] = {\r\n\t\tFuture {\r\n\t\t\tMath.random.toInt match {\r\n\t\t\t\tcase s if s > 50 =>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHealthComponent(self.path.name, ComponentState.NORMAL, \"Random health check is NORMAL\")\r\n\t\t\t\tcase s if s > 10 && s <= 50 =>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHealthComponent(self.path.name, ComponentState.DEGRADED, \"Random health check is DEGRADED\")\r\n\t\t\t\tcase s if s <= 10 =>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHealthComponent(self.path.name, ComponentState.CRITICAL, \"Random health check is CRITICAL\")\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nThis code will create a random health check result based on the value of the random int. As shown the ComponentState can be either NORMAL, DEGRADED or CRITICAL. \r\nLastly if needed a developer can override the checkHealth function that will handle the message, which will by default use getHealth to get the health of the current actor and then traverse the children to get their health, however if there is a requirement to modify this behavior you can simply override it.\r\n\r\n### Logging\r\nStandardized logging is provided by the library. This can be applied to any actor using the trait ActorLoggingAdapter. This will give you the \"log\" variable which will allow you to write info, debug, warn, error and trace messages to the log. If you need to add logging to a non-actor based class, possibly like an object you can use the following code.\r\n```java\r\n\tval externalLogger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.getClass)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWookiee can be used as both a library and a service. To use it as a service a developer would be required to simply execute the HarnessService app, for use as a library the developer would be required to add a dependency in the project's pom and then initialize Wookiee manually. Alternatively the developer could add a dependency for a single component to the POM and use it separetely. For more information on leveraging a single component see the doc specific to that component.\r\n\r\n[**Release Notes**](docs/ReleaseNotes.md)\r\n\r\n# How To\r\nThere are several aspects to utilizing the functionality contained with Wookiee and it's supporting libraries. This\r\nsection outlines the available functionality and how to best utilize the Wookiee Platform.\r\n\r\n### Development Environment\r\nThe purpose of this section is to aggregate notes and processes in setting up development environment for creating services for Wookiee.\r\n\r\n[Instructions](docs/DevSetup.md)\r\n\r\n### Creating a service\r\nAs services are what provides functionality to the Wookiee container, this section provides information on how to\r\ncreate a basic service.\r\n\r\n[Instructions](archetypes/wookiee-service-archetypes/README.md)\r\n\r\n### Creating a component\r\nComponents provide pluggable core functionality in to Wookiee. This allows developers to pick and choose the kind of functionality that they want.\r\n\r\n[Instructions](archetypes/wookiee-component-archetypes/README.md)\r\n\r\n### Components\r\nA component is dynamically loaded in Wookiee. This allows for a developer to then only load the components that they wish to use as part of the Wookiee Platform. A component is defined by a class object with the Component trait found in the wookiee-core project. Wookiee will start up any component that is found in location that is defined by the component-path key in the harness configuration file.\r\n```\r\nwookiee-system {\r\n  # This is the path to the location of the components (defaults to \"components\")\r\n  # Should just contain the jar for the component\r\n  component-path = \"components\"\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. [Http Component](components/wookiee-spray/README.md)\r\n2. [Metrics Component](components/wookiee-metrics/README.md)\r\n3. [Zookeeper Component](components/wookiee-zookeeper/README.md)\r\n4. [Cluster Component](components/wookiee-cluster/README.md)\r\n5. [Cache Component](components/wookiee-cache/README.md)\r\n6. [Memcache Component](components/wookiee-cache-memcache/README.md)\r\n8.

[Socko Component](components/wookiee-socko/README.md)\r\n\r\n### Configuring a component\r\nEach component loaded in Wookiee should provide a default configuration that will fit most situations.  The Wookiee Platform\r\nuses Typesafe Config to load configurations at runtime in layers.  A component's default configuration should be given the lowest\r\npriority, the reference conf, following the layered priority schema set by Typesafe Config.  This can be problematic at times, as third party libs\r\nand components with equally prioritized, overlapping configurations are combined in the application.  To ensure component \r\nconfigurations take precedence, place components jars at the begining of the classpath.  One approach is to separate components\r\nfrom third party libs in the distribution.\r\n\r\nMaven dist.xml\r\n```xml\r\n<assembly>\r\n    <id>bin</id>\r\n    <includeBaseDirectory>false</includeBaseDirectory>\r\n    <formats>\r\n        <format>tar.gz</format>\r\n    </formats>\r\n    <files>\r\n        <file>\r\n            <source>${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}.jar</source>\r\n        </file>\r\n    </files>\r\n    <dependencySets>\r\n        <dependencySet>\r\n            <useProjectArtifact>false</useProjectArtifact>\r\n            <outputDirectory>/lib/thirdparty</outputDirectory>\r\n            <scope>runtime</scope>\r\n            <excludes>\r\n                <exclude>*:wookiee*:jar</exclude>\r\n            </excludes>\r\n        </dependencySet>\r\n        <dependencySet>\r\n            <useProjectArtifact>false</useProjectArtifact>\r\n            <outputDirectory>/lib/components</outputDirectory>\r\n            <scope>runtime</scope>\r\n            <includes>\r\n                <include>*:wookiee*:jar</include>\r\n            </includes>\r\n        </dependencySet>\r\n    </dependencySets>\r\n</assembly>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun command:\r\n```\r\njava -cp *:lib/components/*:lib/thirdparty/* com.webtrends.harness.app.HarnessService\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
